## Beatport Price Checker

This Chrome Extension hopes to help you save money when browsing [Beatport](http://www.beatport.com). Beatport is awesome at providing plenty of *obscure* (non-mainstream) music,
however tracks which are more popular tend to be offered for a cheaper price at larger music online stores such as iTunes and Amazon.
